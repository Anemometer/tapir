# Tapir Member & Shift Management System

Tapir is a member and shift management system to be used by [SuperCoop Berlin](https://supercoop.de).

Tapir has a trunk, but not quite such a beautiful one as 
[Mme. l'Ã©lephan](https://github.com/elefan-grenoble/gestion-compte). Tapir is badass,
[but not quite as badass as the other
animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJm6nDnR2SE). Let's teach Tapir some tricks!

## Running with Docker

    docker-compose up

Yeah, that's it.
